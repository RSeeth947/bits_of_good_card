                Hello! I'm Rupesh and I'm a recent transfer student from
                Michigan State University. I am currently a Sophomore majoring
                in Mathematics and I plan on minoring in CS. One thing that I would
                love to help out in is creating soccer fields in underprivileged
                communities and keeping the environment clean. As a person who loves
                soccer, I would love to see well maintained soccer fields that everyone can University
                can be used in underprivileged communities. Also, you canâ€™t go wrong with a cleaner environment
